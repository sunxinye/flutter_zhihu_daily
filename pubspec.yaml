  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is

  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/guide3.png
    - assets/images/launch_image_bottom.jpg
    - assets/images/diversion_product_home_title.png
    - assets/images/image_dog.png
    - assets/images/image_earth.png
    - assets/images/yellow_round.png
    - assets/images/purple_round.png
    - assets/images/blue_round.png
    - assets/images/light_yellow_round.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Iconfont
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/iconfont.ttf

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
